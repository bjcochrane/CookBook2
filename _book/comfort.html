<p>So now we come to what might be called “What do I do in winter?” section. In fact, living here in southern Ohio, I can now count on at least a few barbecue days every month of the year. But of course there are many days when that is not possible. So, having to retreat indoors, I use a collection of recipes, many derived from my pre-Green Egg days, that yield excellent results using the stovetop, oven, and microwave. In many cases, since I am preparing only 1-2 servings, I can use our toaster oven instead of our lovely Big Chill range.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">5.1.1</span> Lemon Chicken<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#lemon-chicken"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>This recipe is derived from a 40 year old cookbook - <em>The Silver Palate Cookbook</em> by Julee Rosso and Sheila Lukins. At the time of publication, the authors ran a small restaurant in New York City; since then they have expanded to <a href="https://www.silverpalate.com/">the web</a>, where you can find an extensive selection of sauces and recipes. Some of their products may be available at a <a href="https://www.silverpalate.com/stores">store near you</a>.</p>
<p>Note that the big difference between the original recipe and mine is that the chicken is initially broiled rather than fried. This was a technique suggested by my late sister Nancy Cochrane, someone who abhorred grease in cooking. That is indeed true - the results I typically obtain after the broiling are dry and crisp (the chicken will be well moistened in the subsequent baking). Also, I’ve provided what I use for two servings of dark meat, but it can can easily be scaled up or down, and white meat can be used if preferred.</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4 Bone-in chicken thighs<br>
White flour (about 1/3 cup)<br>
1 tsp. ground black pepper<br>
1 tsp. paprika (I use Penzey’s <a href="https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/hungarian-style-half-sharp-paprika/c-24/p-1147/pd-s">Hungarian Half Sharp</a>, but feel free to use your favorite)<br>
1 lemon<br>
brown sugar<br>
1/3 cup chicken broth</p>
</blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Combine the flour, pepper and paprika in a plastic bag.</li>
<li>Zest the lemon and then slice it as thinly as possible.<br>
</li>
<li>Add the chicken pieces one at a time to the bag and make sure they are coated evenly with the flour mix.</li>
<li>Place chicken into a baking dish (a 7 X 11 glass one works fine) skin side up and broil, watching regularly, until the chicken is lightly browned. Flip the chicken over and do the same with the other side</li>
<li>Set the oven to bake at 375<sup>o</sup>. Sprinkle the lemon set and brown sugar evenly over the top of the chicken pieces. Pour the broth into the dish (not over the chicken).</li>
<li>Bake at 375<sup>o</sup> for 35-40 minutes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Feel free to be creative in how you serve; I usually have this with white rice and a side of applesauce.</p>

<p>This one is lifted straight from the Penzey’s web - it’s been tweaked a little and adapted for slow cooking.The biggest change I made was to double the amount of Curry and Berbere seasoning, rendering the dish spicier. For firmer chicken, cook on the stove top; rather than 3 hours of slow cooking, cook for ~45 minutes over medium low heat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>6 boneless skinless chicken thighs, cubed<br>
1 tbsp olive oil<br>
1 small red onion, chopped coursely<br>
~ 2 tsp curry powder (I use Penzey’s [Now Curry]<br>

<p>This is one of the very few recipes that I concocted by myself - I don’t really even remember when. For convenience sake, I usually do it in our slow cooker, but it can also be done (in less time) on the stove top. I’ve included the slow cooker instructions below, with parenthetical notes about doing it on the stove top.</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1-2 tbsp olive oil
2 lb. boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1 inch cubes (white meat can be substituted if you prefer)<br>
1 red onion, chopped<br>
2-3 cloves garlic, chopped<br>
1 bell pepper, chopped<br>
1 14.5 oz can diced tomatoes, drainged<br>
1/2 cup red wine
1 tbsp. red wine vinegar<br>
1/4 - 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper<br>
1 tsp black pepper<br>
2 tsp <a href="https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/italian-herb-mix/c-24/p-183/pd-s">Penzey’s Italian Herb Mix</a> (a mix of dried basil and oregano can be substituted)</p>
</blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Set the slow cooker to sauté and add the olive oil and onions. Sauté for 10 minutes until onions or soft (alternatively, do this in a metal casserole over medium heat on your stove).<br>
</li>
<li>Add the garlic and bell pepper and cook for 5 more minutes.</li>
<li>Add the chicken and cook, stirring, until it is browned (5-8 minutes).<br>
</li>
<li>Add the tomatoes, wine, crushed red pepper, black pepper and Italian seasoning to the mix<sup>*</sup>
</li>
<li>Set the slow cooker on “slow cook - high”, cover, and let it cook for 3 hours (On the stove top, reduce heat to medium low, cover, and cook for 45 minutes to an hour)</li>
<li>Uncover the pot. If the liquid needs reducing, return the slow cooker to sauté and cook until the desired consistency is achieved (on the stove top, raise heat to medium and do the same).</li>
<li>Serve over white rice or pastas</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><sup>*</sup> In actuality I don’t usually measure the spices - I just sprinkle them on as I see fit. Thus, you should consider the amounts given as approximations and fee free to adjust them to taste. Furthermore, if you have an Italian herb blend you like, feel free to use it.</p>

<p>This is another old one, dating back (for me) to the 1970’s and is derived from <em>The Complete Book of Pasta</em>, by Jack Denton Scott. A more formal name for it is Rigatoni All’Arrabbiatta. It is simple to make, and leftovers reheat well. The biggest change I made was to add onions and garlic to it. I also do not saute the bacon; rather I let it cook with the sauce, resulting in what I think is a much more flavorful dish.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<p>1 tbsp. olive oil<br>
1 small onion, coarsely sliced<br>
2 garlic gloves, grated<br>
4 slices bacon<br>
2-3 jalapeno peppers, sliced<br>
1 28 oz can tomatoes (San Marzano are the best, but any will work)<br>
Italian seasoning and black pepper to taste<br>
6-8 oz pasta (the original calls for rigatoni, but I often substitute penné, ziti, or some other similar tube variety)<br>
grated parmesan or romano cheese</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Sauté onions and garlic in oil until soft in a 12 inch skillet, about 5-10 minutes</li>
<li>Add tomatoes, bacon, peppers and seasoning.</li>
<li>Cook uncovered over medium heat for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally with a spatula, chopping the tomatoes and breaking apart the bacon as you do so.</li>
<li>Cook uncovered over medium heat for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally with a spatula, chopping the tomatoes as you do so.</li>
<li>While the sauce is reducing, cook your pasta by your favorite method (I use water with a dash of olive oil) *al denté and drain.</li>
<li>Combine the sauce and the pasta and serve, with parmesan or romano cheese available to sprinkle over servings.</li>
</ol>
<p>Like all Italian food, this goes well with a serving of crusty bread (like <a href="bread-1.html#baguettes">baguettes</a> and a side salad.</p>

<p>When possible, I really prefer grilling shrimp, but when that is impossible, here’s a recipe I like to use. It comes from <em>Italian</em>, by Whiteman, Wright and Boggiano, a book I picked up in a bargain bin a long time back. Note that the sauce is somewhat similar to my recipe for <a href="comfort.html#cacciatore">chicken cacciatore</a>, and it can be used as a basic red sauce as desired (it works well as a pizza sauce or by itself over pasta).</p>

<p>This is an old classic of mine, one that I developed in the 1970’s. As I noted earlier, it was derived from a recipe for cheese sauce in <em>The Joy of Cooking</em>; I have changed the cheese mix, livened up the spicing, and incorporated use of my microwave oven into the preparation.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<p>3 tbsp. butter<br>
2 tbsp flour<br>
1 cup whole milk<br>
1/2 tbsp dry mustard<br>
1/2 tbsp hot paprika<br>
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper<br>
6-8 oz pasta (penné, rigatoni or ziti work well)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In a glass casserole with a cover, melt the butter in the microwave (about 1 minute on high).</li>
<li>Add the flour to the melted butter and stir briskly with a fork to make an lump-free slurry</li>
<li>Slowly add the milk, stirring initially with a fork and then with a spoon. Again, you want to end up with a lump-free mix.</li>
<li>Sprinkle the three spices on the mixture and mix in.</li>
<li>Microwave the mixture, covered, on medium, for about two minutes.</li>
<li>Remove and stir. Your goal is to have the mixture thicken to the consistency of a thick gravy.</li>
<li>Add the cheese and microwave on medium for another two minutes. Stir and repeat. Now all of the cheese should be melted and you should have a nice alfredo-style sauce. If it is two thick, stir in a little more milk and microwave briefly.</li>
<li>At some point, cook the pasta <em>al denté</em> with a little olive oil added. Drain, combine with the cheese sauce and serve.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that this recipe is one that does not reheat well. You can try if you want to, but I generally eat it all or discard any leftovers. It goes very well with pilsner.</p>
