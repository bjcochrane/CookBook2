# Big Green Egg {#bge}

So what is a Big Green Egg?  A more generic name is a komodo cooker - a heavy duty ceramic charcoal cooker, shaped like the ubiquitous Weber Cooker, but much heavier and more expensive.  If your budget can afford it, I recommend spending the bucks for an Egg, especially if you anticipate doing a lot of low temperature barbecuing.  It is much easier to control the temperature than in a Weber-style device, and a load of charcoal goes a lot longer (a 36 hour barbecue of pork butt or brisket can be completed on a single generous charcoal load).  Also, with proper handling, one will last forever, so that while the upfront costs are a challenge, over time you may end up saving money - in my prior life, I found that metal cookers had a lifespan of something like 3-5 years.

With respect to what size to get, I strongly recommend the large (original) Egg.  As I mentioned earlier, we started with a medium (recommended for cooking for 2) but quickly found it to be overly constraining - I could barely fir four ears of [corn on the cob](#corn) into it.  Furthermore, you can forget grilling multiple different items at the same time.  

>Note that there is an extra large model, which is huge.  If you have a big family or are a grilling fanatic, you might want to consider it, but is is far larger than anything I can foresee ever needing.  

## Charcoal and Lighting

There are two cardinal rules regarding what to use in a Green Egg:

1.  **NEVER use lighter fluid.  It will soak into the ceramic and ruin your investment.**
2.  **Only use lump charcoal, not briquets, essentially for the same reason.**

The instructions for you Egg will recommend that you only use "genuine Big Green Egg Charcoal".  Ignore that advice.  Yes, BGE charcoal is high quality, but a) it is expensive, and b) it may be hard to find.  I have been using supermarket-branded lump charcoal for years and have found it to be quite satisfactory.

With respect to lighting, most sources recommend using a chimney, in which you mix some charcoal and some paper.  The paper is ignited, and when the charcoal is burning, the chimney is removed and more charcoal is added as needed.  I'll be honest - I've never tried this.  Rather, I load the charcoal into the egg, insert 2-3 paraffin-saturated composit sticks into it, and then ignite them.  With this method, I reliably get a nice bed of hot coals in 10-15 minutes.

## Accessories

For grilling, it certainly is possible to use your new Big Green Egg "out of the box", however a number of accessories, from the mundane to the sophisticated (and of course from cheap to expensive) help to greatly expand your grilling and barbecuing repertoire.  Here are a few I find to be invaluable:

1.  An **ash tool**, something you should order when you purchase your Egg.  It is absolutely necessary for removing ashes from the Egg through the lower vent.  
2.  A **garden trowel**,  which facilitates arranging the charcoal once it is in the egg.
3.  A [**ConvEGGctor**](https://biggreenegg.com/product/conveggtor/).  I hate the name, but it's a great device if you want to use your egg more like an oven than a grill.  I routinely use it with brisket and smoked pork, also for bread, which I occasionally cook in the Egg.
