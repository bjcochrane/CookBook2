# Dedication

My adventures in the kitchen date back to my childhood, and I am actually thankful that neither my mother nor my father (Vincent and Jean Cochrane) had minimal interest in cooking, and thus eagerly encouraged my childhood desire to explore.  As an adult, my family - both my first wife, the late Barbara Leyden, and my second, Alice Kahn, provided encouragement and constructive criticism where necessary.  Finally, my two sons, Steven and John Cochrane, are continuing the cooking tradition - Steven as a vegetarian and John as a budding pitmaster.  This book is lovingly dedicated to all of them.
