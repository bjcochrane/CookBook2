# "Comfort" Food {#comfort}

So now we come to what might be called "What do I do in winter?" section.  In fact, living here in southern Ohio, I can now count on at least a few barbecue days every month of the year.  But of course there are many days when that is not possible.  So, having to retreat indoors, I use a collection of recipes, many derived from my pre-Green Egg days, that yield excellent results using the stovetop, oven, and microwave.  In many cases, since I am preparing only 1-2 servings, I can use our toaster oven instead of our lovely Big Chill range.

## Chicken 

### Lemon Chicken

This recipe is derived from a 40 year old cookbook - *The Silver Palate Cookbook* by Julee Rosso and Sheila Lukins.  At the time of publication, the authors ran a small restaurant in New York City; since then they have expanded to [the web](https://www.silverpalate.com/), where you can find an extensive selection of sauces and recipes.  Some of their products may be available at a [store near you](https://www.silverpalate.com/stores).

Note that the big difference between the original recipe and mine is that the chicken is initially broiled rather than fried.  This was a technique suggested by my late sister Nancy Cochrane, someone who abhorred grease in cooking.  That is indeed true - the results I typically obtain after the broiling are dry and crisp (the chicken will be well moistened in the subsequent baking).  Also, I've provided what I use for two servings of dark meat, but it can can easily be scaled up or down, and white meat can be used if preferred.

Ingredients:

> 4 Bone-in chicken thighs  
> White flour (about 1/3 cup)  
> 1 tsp. ground black pepper  
> 1 tsp. paprika (I use Penzey's [Hungarian Half Sharp](https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/hungarian-style-half-sharp-paprika/c-24/p-1147/pd-s), but feel free to use your favorite)  
> 1 lemon  
> brown sugar  
> 1/3 cup chicken broth  

1.  Combine the flour, pepper and paprika in a plastic bag.
2.  Zest the lemon and then slice it as thinly as possible.  
2.  Add the chicken pieces one at a time to the bag and make sure they are coated evenly with the flour mix.
3.  Place chicken into a baking dish (a 7 X 11 glass one works fine) skin side up and broil, watching regularly, until the chicken is lightly browned.  Flip the chicken over and do the same with the other side
4.  Set the oven to bake at 375^o^.  Sprinkle the lemon set and brown sugar evenly over the top of the chicken pieces.  Pour the broth into the dish (not over the chicken).
5.  Bake at 375^o^ for 35-40 minutes.

Feel free to be creative in how you serve; I usually have this with white rice and a side of applesauce. 

### Berbere/curry chicken

### Chicken Cacciatore {#cacciatore}

This is one of the very few recipes that I concocted by myself - I don't really even remember when.  For convenience sake, I usually do it in our slow cooker, but it can also be done (in less time) on the stove top.  I've included the slow cooker instructions below, with parenthetical notes about doing it on the stove top.

Ingredients:  

> 1-2 tbsp olive oil
> 2 lb. boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1 inch cubes (white meat can be substituted if you prefer)  
> 1 red onion, chopped  
> 2-3 cloves garlic, chopped  
> 1 bell pepper, chopped  
> 1 14.5 oz can diced tomatoes, drainged  
> 1/2 cup red wine
> 1 tbsp. red wine vinegar
> 1/4 - 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper  
> 1 tsp black pepper  
> 2 tsp [Penzey's Italian Herb Mix](https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/italian-herb-mix/c-24/p-183/pd-s) (a mix of dried basil and oregano can be substituted)  

1.  Set the slow cooker to sauté and add the olive oil and onions.  Sauté for 10 minutes until onions or soft (alternatively, do this in a metal casserole over medium heat on your stove).  
2.  Add the garlic and bell pepper and cook for 5 more minutes.
3.  Add the chicken and cook, stirring, until it is browned (5-8 minutes).  
4.  Add the tomatoes, wine, crushed red pepper, black pepper and Italian seasoning to the mix<sup>*</sup>
5.  Set the slow cooker on "slow cook - high", cover, and let it cook for 3 hours (On the stove top, reduce heat to medium low, cover, and cook for 45 minutes to an hour)
6.  Uncover the pot.  If the liquid needs reducing, return the slow cooker to sauté and cook until the desired consistency is achieved (on the stove top, raise heat to medium and do the same.
7.  Serve over white rice or pastas

> <sup>*</sup> In actuality I don't usually measure the spices - I just sprinkle them on as I see fit.  Thus, you should consider the amounts given as approximations and fee free to adjust them to taste.  Furthermore, if you have an italian herb blend you like, feel free to use it.

### Shrimp in red sauce

When possible, I really prefer grilling shrimp, but when that is impossible, here's a recipe I like to use. It comes from *Italian*, by Whiteman, Wright and Boggiano, a book I picked up in a bargain bin a long time back.  Note that the sauce is somewhat similar to my recipe for [chicken cacciatore](#cacciatore), and it can be used as a basic red sauce as desired (it works well as a pizza sauce or by itself over pasta).

> 1/2 to 3/4 lb. shrimp, peeled and de-veined
