# "Comfort" Food {#comfort}

So now we come to what might be called "What do I do in winter?" section.  In fact, living here in southern Ohio, I can now count on at least a few barbecue days every month of the year.  But of course there are many days when that is not possible.  So, having to retreat indoors, I use a collection of recipes, many derived from my pre-Green Egg days, that yield excellent results using the stovetop, oven, and microwave.  In many cases, since I am preparing only 1-2 servings, I can use our toaster oven instead of our lovely Big Chill range.

## Chicken 

### Lemon Chicken

This recipe is derived from a 40 year old cookbook - *The Silver Palate Cookbook* by Julee Rosso and Sheila Lukins.  At the time of publication, the authors ran a small restaurant in New York City; since then they have expanded to [the web](https://www.silverpalate.com/), where you can find an extensive selection of sauces and recipes.  Some of their products may be available at a [store near you](https://www.silverpalate.com/stores).

Note that the big difference between the original recipe and mine is that the chicken is initially broiled rather than fried.  This was a technique suggested by my late sister Nancy Cochrane, someone who abhorred grease in cooking.  That is indeed true - the results I typically obtain after the broiling are dry and crisp (the chicken will be well moistened in the subsequent baking).  Also, I've provided what I use for two servings of dark meat, but it can can easily be scaled up or down, and white meat can be used if preferred.

Ingredients:

> 4 Bone-in chicken thighs  
> White flour (about 1/3 cup)  
> 1 tsp. ground black pepper  
> 1 tsp. paprika (I use Penzey's [Hungarian Half Sharp](https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/hungarian-style-half-sharp-paprika/c-24/p-1147/pd-s), but feel free to use your favorite)  
> 1 lemon  
> brown sugar  
> 1/3 cup chicken broth  

1.  Combine the flour, pepper and paprika in a plastic bag.
2.  Zest the lemon and then slice it as thinly as possible.  
2.  Add the chicken pieces one at a time to the bag and make sure they are coated evenly with the flour mix.
3.  Place chicken into a baking dish (a 7 X 11 glass one works fine) skin side up and broil, watching regularly, until the chicken is lightly browned.  Flip the chicken over and do the same with the other side
4.  Set the oven to bake at 375^o^.  Sprinkle the lemon set and brown sugar evenly over the top of the chicken pieces.  Pour the broth into the dish (not over the chicken).
5.  Bake at 375^o^ for 35-40 minutes.

Feel free to be creative in how you serve; I usually have this with white rice and a side of applesauce.
