# International Cooking

Up to this point, most of the recipes have been pretty American in nature.  There is nothing wrong with American cooking - indeed the country is home to a variety of excellent cuisines.  Since the US is, with the exception of Native Americans, a country of relatively recent immigrants, it is not surprising that most of its cuisines have international influences.  In this section, however, I want to concentrate on truly international dishes - ones you might find being served regularly if you visit their country of origin.

In each of the following sections, I begin with a section on ingredients.  It turns out that, with a little hunting, most of them are relatively easy to find, especially if your're prepared to make your own spice mixtures.  Many of the ingredients are available at any grocery store, while others can be found at specialty markets or online.

La Boqueria in Barcelona, which bills itself as "The greatest food market in the world."

I first got interested in Spanish cooking when I visited my son in Barcelona (ok, actually in Catelonia) a decade ago.  Barcelona is a great city in many ways, but what I enjoyed most about the food were the ubiquitous tapas restaurants.  My favorite experience was at one in Old Town (I don't remember the name) that we went to for a light supper after having spent a day in nearby Tarragona and eating a late lunch there.  At this place, all of the tapas contained toothpicks, and you selected the ones you wanted to eat. After eating, a server came by, counted your toothpicks, and billed accordingly.

Compared to Indian food, Spanish food is quite mild.  However, it is quite flavorful, and it incorporates ones found in both African and European cooking.

[La Tienda](http://www.latienda.com) is a great source for both ingredients and recipes.  Most of those that follow are from that source.  All of these can be served as tapas (think summer party) or as a meal.

### Grilled Shrimp in Serrano Ham

Spanish ham is nothing like the domestic ham I grew up with - you need to try it to appreciate its unique flavors.  I am fortunate enough to have a local source (Jungle Jim's north of Cincinnati), but you can also purchase it from La Tienda (although their shipping charges are steep).

**Ingredients**

> 1/2 lb. large shrimp  
1 tbsp olive oil  
1 tsp smoked paprika  
salt and ppepper to taste  
4 oz. sliced Jamon Serrano

1.  Prepare your grill for grilling at 450^o^ F.
1.  Peel and devein the shrimp, leaving the tails on.
2.  Mix together the olive oil, paprika, and salt and pepper.
3.  Add the shrimp and toss to coat.
4.  Wrap each shrimp with a 2 inch piece of the jamon and place on a skewer.  If you are using wooden ones, be sure you have soaked them for at least 20 minutes prior to use.
5.  Place on grill and cook for 1-2 minutes per side, until the shrimp are opaque and the ham has crisp edges.
6.  Serve immediately.

### [Pork Kebabs](https://www.tienda.com/recipes/pork-kebabs.html)

This is another grilled recipe, one that can be used either as a tapa or, with rice and vegetables, a complete meal.

**Ingredients**

> 1 lb pork loin, cut into 1 inch cubes  
> 6 tbsp olive oil  
> 2 tsp fresh thyme leaves or 1 tsp dried  
> 1 tbsp smoked paprika  
> 1 tsp ground cumin  
> 1 tsp dried oregano
> 1 tsp [ras el hanut](#ras)  
> 1 clove garlic, minced  
1 tsp red pepper flakes, or to taste
1 bay leaf, crumbled  
1 tsp black pepper  
0-2 tsp sea salt (to taste)

1.  Mix all of the ingredients except the pork in either a bowl or a large ziploc bag.
2.  Add the pork, mix well, and refrigerate overnight or up to 2 days.
3.  Soak a set of wooden skewers in water for at least 30 minutes.  Prepare your grill for grilling at 450^o^ F.
4.  Thread four pieces of pork onto each skewer.
5.  Grill for 5 minutes or so, basting occasionally with the marinade.
6.  Flip the skewers over and cook for an additional five minutes.
7.  Serve with crusty bread and salsa brava<sup>*</sup> for dipping.

<sup>*</sup> Salsa brava is a staple of Catalonian cooking.  It can be purchased from [La Tienda](https://www.tienda.com/products/salsa-brava-sauce-espinaler-sc-68.html) or [made as follows](https://moonandspoonandyum.com/salsa-bravas/):

> 3 tbsp olive oil  
1 onion, chopped  
5 cloves garlic, minced  
2 tbsp hot smoked paprika  
1 tbsp hot paprika  
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper    
1 14.5 oz can fire roasted tomatoes  
2-3 roasted piquillo peppers  
2 tbsp vinegar of choice  
salt to taste  

1.  Saute the garlic and onion in the oil for 5-10 minutes.
2.  Add the remaining ingredients (except salt), bring to a boil, and cook for 10 minutes.
3.  Turn off heat and blend with an immersion blender.

Serve immediately or refrigerate up to 10 days.  Freeze for longer term storage.


## Other Mediterranean

### Ras el Hanout {#ras}

This is a very flavorful Moroccan mixture, one that also turns up in Spanish dishes.  This particular recipe is from [allrecipes.com](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/150574/ras-el-hanout/), incorporating a few reviewers suggestions.

**Ingredients**

> 1 tsp salt  
1 tsp ground cumin  
1 tsp ground ginger  
1 tsp ground turmeric  
1/4 tsp ground cinnamon  
3/4 tsp ground black pepper  
1/2 tsp ground white pepper  
1/2 tsp ground coriander  
1/2 tsp ground red pepper  
1/2 tsp ground coriander seed
1/2 tsp ground allspice  
1/2 tsp ground nutmeg  
1/4 tsp ground cloves  
1/2 tsp ground cardamom (optional)

Mix everything together and store in an airtight container.  Doing so in the freezer will extend the lifetime of the mixture.

### Lamb Meat balls

Below are two recipes, one from Turkey and one from Morocco.  The Turkish one is an old standby; the Moroccan one a new one. As you can see, the flavoring and preparation are similar.  Both can be made with other meats (beef or pork), but lamb is what makes these recipes sing.

#### Turkish

This one comes from *Turkish Cookery* by GÃ¼lseren Ramazanoglu, a small book that my first wife picked up while touring Turkey 30 years ago. It's a great little book, however it is not available in the US. 

**Ingredients**

> 1 lb ground lamb or veal  
> 1 medium onion, chopped finely  
> 1/4 cup panko bread crumbs  
> 1 clove garlic, chopped finely
> 1/2 tsp cumin
> 1 tsp baking powder  

1.  Preheat your oven to 350^o^ F.<sup>*</sup>
1.  Combine all of the ingredients in a mixing bowl, blending them together with your clean hands.
2.  Shape them into six sausage shaped meatballs and place on a foil covered sheet pan that has had a light coat of spray oil applied
3.  Bake for 12-14 minutes

This goes well with rice.

<sup>*</sup>The original recipe calls for the meat ball to be fried.  That is certainly an option, but it is rather messy and tedious.

#### Moroccan

This comes from the [Limerick Lane Winery site](https://www.limericklanewines.com/moroccan-spiced-lamb-meatballs-paired-with-estate-cuvee/).  Such sites can be an interesting source of recipes - of course they are trying to sell their wines, but many of the better ones provide recipes with suggested wine pairings as well.  I have made a couple of changes, adding panko bread crumbs and deleting the salt (1 tsp) called for in the original recipe.


**Ingredients**

*For the meatballs*

> 1 lb ground lamb  
> 1/4 cup unseasoned panko bread crumbs  
> 1/2 cup onion, chopped finely  
> 1/2 cup chopped parsley leaves (I usually don't bother with parsley - to me it adds color but not flavor)  
> 1/2 cup chopped cilantro leaves  
> 1 tsp ground cumin  
> 1 tsp ground coriander  
> 1 tsp paprika  
> 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon  

*For topping (optional)*

> 1/2 cup chopped mint leaves  
> 1.2 cup Greek yogurt

1.  Preheat oven (or toaster oven) to 350^o^ F.
2.  Combine all of the meatball ingredients in a bowl.
3.  Form the meat mix into balls.  The recipe recommends making 15-18 one ounce balls, but there is nothing wrong with making fewer, larger ones.
4.  Cover a sheet pan with foil and spray it with oil
5.  Place into oven and bake for 12-14 minutes.
6.  If you are making the topping, mix the ingredients for it together.
7.  Serve however you want - I usually do so with rice.
